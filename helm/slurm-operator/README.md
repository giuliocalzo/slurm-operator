## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| certManager.duration | string | `"43800h0m0s"` | Duration of certificate life. |
| certManager.enabled | bool | `true` | Enable cert-manager for certificate management. |
| certManager.renewBefore | string | `"8760h0m0s"` | Certificate renewal time. Should be before the expiration. |
| certManager.secretName | string | `"slurm-operator-webhook-ca"` | The secret to be (created and) mounted. |
| crds | object | `{"enabled":false}` | Configure Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). |
| crds.enabled | bool | `false` | Whether this helm chart should manage the CRD and its upgrades. |
| externalCertInjection.enabled | bool | `false` | Mount a pre-existing TLS Secret instead of provisioning one. |
| externalCertInjection.secretName | string | `""` | Name of a pre-existing kubernetes.io/tls Secret containing `tls.crt`, `tls.key`, and `ca.crt`. Must be set explicitly when `enabled` is true; intentionally has no default to avoid silently reusing the chart-managed Secret name during migrations. |
| extraObjects | list | `[]` | Extra Kubernetes objects to deploy alongside the chart. Each entry is rendered as a standalone Kubernetes object. Supports Helm templating (e.g. {{ .Release.Namespace }}). |
| fullnameOverride | string | `""` | Overrides the full name of the release. |
| imagePullPolicy | string | `"IfNotPresent"` | Set the default image pull policy. |
| imagePullSecrets | list | `[]` | Sets the image pull secrets. Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/ |
| nameOverride | string | `""` | Overrides the name of the release. |
| namespaceOverride | string | `""` | Overrides the namespace of the release. |
| operator.accountingWorkers | int | `4` | Set the max concurrent workers for the Accounting controller. |
| operator.affinity | object | `{}` | Affinity for pod assignment. Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity |
| operator.controllerWorkers | int | `4` | Set the max concurrent workers for the Controller controller. |
| operator.enabled | bool | `true` | Enables the operator. |
| operator.healthPort | int | `8081` | Set the port used for health checks. |
| operator.image | object | `{"digest":null,"repository":"ghcr.io/slinkyproject/slurm-operator","tag":null}` | The image to use. Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#image-names |
| operator.imagePullPolicy | string | `"IfNotPresent"` | Set the image pull policy. |
| operator.leaderElection | bool | `true` | Enable leader election for slurm-operator |
| operator.logLevel | string | `"info"` | Set the log level by string (e.g. error, info, debug) or number (e.g. 1..5). |
| operator.loginsetWorkers | int | `4` | Set the max concurrent workers for the LoginSet controller. |
| operator.metricsPort | int | `8080` | Set the port used by the metrics server. Value of "0" will disable it. |
| operator.metricsSecure | bool | `false` | Serve the metrics endpoint securely via HTTPS with authn/authz. Requires metricsPort to be non-zero. Scraping clients must present a token authorized to access /metrics (e.g. bound to the metrics-reader ClusterRole). The endpoint uses a generated self-signed certificate, so scrapers must skip TLS verification (e.g. insecureSkipVerify). |
| operator.namespaces | string | `""` | Comma-separated list of namespaces the operator will watch. If empty, all namespaces are watched. |
| operator.nodeSelector | object | `{}` | Node label selector for pod assignment. Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector |
| operator.nodesetWorkers | int | `4` | Set the max concurrent workers for the NodeSet controller. |
| operator.pdb.enabled | bool | `false` | Enable PodDisruptionBudget. |
| operator.pdb.maxUnavailable | string | `nil` | Maximum pods that may be unavailable (int or quoted percent). Rendered only when set, and takes precedence over `minAvailable`. |
| operator.pdb.minAvailable | int | `1` | Minimum pods that must remain available after eviction (int or quoted percent). |
| operator.podSecurityContext | object | `{}` | Pod-level security context for the operator pod. Applied to all containers in the pod. Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/ |
| operator.profile | bool | `false` | Enable Go profiling for slurm-operator |
| operator.profileAddr | string | `"localhost:6060"` | Set the port used for exposing Go profiling metrics. This should never be exposed on a public network. |
| operator.replicas | int | `1` | Set the number of replicas to deploy. |
| operator.resources | object | `{}` | The container resource limits and requests. Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-requests-and-limits-of-pod-and-container |

| operator.serviceAccount.name | string | `""` | Set the service account to use (and create). |
| operator.slowStartInitialBatchSize | int | `1` | Set the initial concurrency for batched NodeSet sync operations. Each successful batch doubles until the work is exhausted, so raising this reduces the number of sequential barriers on large NodeSets at the cost of weaker error batching. Values below 1 are treated as 1. |

Scraping clients must present a token authorized to access /metrics (e.g. bound to the metrics-reader ClusterRole). The endpoint uses a generated self-signed certificate, so scrapers must skip TLS verification (e.g. insecureSkipVerify). |
